# Introduction
- The call center analysis dashboard seeks to highlight different KPI's for contact center agents, managers and stakeholders as a whole.
- DAX Concepts on PowerBi were used to come up with new measures such as: 
    - Satisfaction rating.
    - Speed of Answer.
    - Percentage of answered calls.
    - Average satisfaction.
 
 ## KPI Analysis
 The following KPI's were analyzed, to investigate the data, and visualize key points that needed attention:
 -  Total number of calls answered and abandoned
 -  Speed of answer
 -  Length of calls
 -  Overall customer satisfaction
 
 ## Data Sourcing
 This is a sample dataset from the original.
 Names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of the individuals.

## Data Cleaning
- The data required no cleaning.
- PowerBI automatically connected the dataset into a star schema model

## Data Modelling
- DAX formulas were used to create new measures for the analysis of the KPI's
- For example, the following formula was used to calculate the "Satisfaction Rate" of customers.
